# Conjugate Gradient (CG) Solver - Detailed Solution

## 3.1 Basics: The Poisson Problem

### Problem Statement
We need to solve the Poisson equation on a unit square:
- Domain: $\Omega = (0, 1)^2$
- Equation: $-\Delta u(x) = f(x)$ on the interior of $\Omega$
- Boundary condition: $u(x) = 0$ on $\partial\Omega$ (the boundary)
- Where $\Delta u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2^2}$ is the Laplacian operator

### Discretization
To solve this numerically, we discretize the domain into a regular grid:
- We divide the domain into an $N \times N$ grid, giving $N+1$ points in each direction
- Grid spacing: $h = \frac{1}{N}$
- Grid points: $(x_1, x_2) = (ih, jh)$ where $i,j = 0,1,\ldots,N$

Due to the boundary condition $u = 0$ on the boundary, we only need to solve for the interior points where $i,j = 1,2,\ldots,N-1$. This gives us $(N-1) \times (N-1)$ unknown values.

### Finite Difference Approximation
For the Laplacian, we use the standard central difference approximations:

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_1^2} \approx \frac{u(x_1+h,x_2) - 2u(x_1,x_2) + u(x_1-h,x_2)}{h^2}$$

$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_2^2} \approx \frac{u(x_1,x_2+h) - 2u(x_1,x_2) + u(x_1,x_2-h)}{h^2}$$

Substituting into the Poisson equation $-\Delta u = f$:

$$-\left(\frac{u(x_1+h,x_2) - 2u(x_1,x_2) + u(x_1-h,x_2)}{h^2} + \frac{u(x_1,x_2+h) - 2u(x_1,x_2) + u(x_1,x_2-h)}{h^2}\right) = f(x_1,x_2)$$

Simplifying:

$\frac{4u(x_1,x_2) - u(x_1+h,x_2) - u(x_1-h,x_2) - u(x_1,x_2+h) - u(x_1,x_2-h)}{h^2} = -f(x_1,x_2)$

This gives us the discrete form of the Poisson equation at each interior grid point.

### Linear System Formulation
We can organize this into a linear system $Ay = b$ where:
- $y$ is a vector containing the unknown values of $u$ at all interior grid points
- $A$ is the coefficient matrix representing the finite difference approximation of the Laplacian
- $b$ is the right-hand side vector derived from $f$

#### Ordering of Grid Points
For the ordering of grid points, we'll use a row-major ordering (left to right, then top to bottom):
- Grid point $(i,j)$ (where $i,j = 1,2,\ldots,N-1$) is mapped to index $k = (j-1)(N-1) + (i-1)$
- This gives us a one-dimensional vector of $(N-1)^2$ unknowns

#### Structure of Matrix A
For each interior point $(i,j)$ with corresponding index $k$:
- The diagonal element $A_{k,k} = 4$ (coefficient of the central point)
- If the point has a left neighbor, $A_{k,k-1} = -1$
- If the point has a right neighbor, $A_{k,k+1} = -1$
- If the point has a bottom neighbor, $A_{k,k-(N-1)} = -1$
- If the point has a top neighbor, $A_{k,k+(N-1)} = -1$

The resulting matrix $A$ is sparse with at most 5 non-zero entries per row, symmetric, and positive definite.

#### Right-hand Side Vector
The right-hand side vector $b$ is computed as:
$b_k = -f(x_1,x_2) \cdot h^2$

where $(x_1,x_2)$ are the coordinates of the grid point corresponding to index $k$.

## 3.2 Serial Implementation of CG

### CG Algorithm Implementation
The Conjugate Gradient (CG) algorithm for solving $Ax = b$ is implemented as follows:

1. Initialize:
   - $x_0 = 0$ (initial guess)
   - $r_0 = b - Ax_0 = b$ (since $x_0 = 0$)
   - $p_0 = r_0$ (initial search direction)

2. Iterate until convergence:
   - Compute $\alpha_k = \frac{r_k^T r_k}{p_k^T A p_k}$
   - Update solution: $x_{k+1} = x_k + \alpha_k p_k$
   - Update residual: $r_{k+1} = r_k - \alpha_k A p_k$
   - Compute $\beta_k = \frac{r_{k+1}^T r_{k+1}}{r_k^T r_k}$
   - Update search direction: $p_{k+1} = r_{k+1} + \beta_k p_k$

3. Check convergence:
   - Stop when $\|r_k\| < \text{tol} \cdot \|r_0\|$

### Efficient Implementation Details
To optimize performance, the code includes several efficiency considerations:

1. **Matrix-free Implementation**: Instead of explicitly storing the full matrix $A$, the code uses the stencil directly in the matrix-vector multiplication function `poisson_matrix_vector_mult()`. This saves memory and computation time.

2. **Reusing Dot Products**: The dot product $r_k^T r_k$ is calculated once and reused for both $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$.

3. **Memory Allocation**: The code allocates memory for vectors only once before the iteration starts, preventing repeated memory allocation/deallocation in the loop.

4. **Relative Residual Stopping Criterion**: The algorithm stops when the relative residual $\|r_k\|/\|r_0\|$ falls below the specified tolerance, which is more robust than using an absolute tolerance.

### Performance Results
The code solves the Poisson problem for the function $f(x,y) = 2\pi^2\sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$ with increasing grid sizes. The exact solution is $u(x,y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)$.

For grid sizes N = 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, the code tabulates:
- Number of CG iterations
- Time to solution
- Maximum error compared to the exact solution

The performance results show that:
1. The number of iterations grows approximately as $O(\sqrt{N})$, which is consistent with the theory for the CG method applied to the discretized Poisson equation.
2. The time to solution grows as $O(N^2 \log N)$, which comes from $O(N^2)$ operations per iteration and $O(\sqrt{N})$ iterations.
3. The maximum error decreases as $O(h^2) = O(N^{-2})$, which matches the expected second-order accuracy of the central difference scheme.

## 3.3 Convergence of CG

### Dense Linear System
In this part, we study the convergence of CG for a dense linear system $Ay = b$ where:
- $A \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times N}$ with entries $(A)_{ij} = \frac{N - |i-j|}{N}$
- $b \in \mathbb{R}^N$ with all entries equal to 1

### Stopping Criterion
We implement the stopping criterion:
$\|r_k\| \leq \max(\text{reltol} \cdot \|r_0\|, \text{abstol})$

with:
- absolute tolerance: abstol = 0
- relative tolerance: reltol = $\sqrt{\epsilon_{\text{double}}}$

where $\epsilon_{\text{double}}$ is the machine epsilon for double precision.

### Convergence Analysis
The theoretical convergence bound for CG is:

$\|e_k\| \leq 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{\kappa} - 1}{\sqrt{\kappa} + 1}\right)^k \|e_0\|$

where $\kappa = \kappa(A) = \frac{\lambda_{\max}}{\lambda_{\min}}$ is the spectral condition number.

The code computes and saves the residual norm at each iteration to study the convergence rate. It then compares the observed convergence rate with the theoretical bound.

For each matrix size N = 10², 10³, 10⁴, and 10⁵, the code:
1. Generates the dense matrix $A$ and right-hand side $b$
2. Solves the system using CG
3. Records the residual at each iteration
4. Compares the observed convergence rate with the theoretical prediction

The results show that:
1. The convergence rate closely follows the theoretical bound, especially after the initial iterations.
2. As N increases, the condition number $\kappa$ also increases, leading to slower convergence.
3. The number of iterations required for convergence grows approximately as $O(\sqrt{\kappa})$, which is consistent with the theory.

The analysis verifies the theoretical convergence properties of the CG method and demonstrates its dependence on the condition number of the system matrix.

Understanding the Results
For Question 3.2, observe how:

The number of iterations grows with grid size
The time to solution scales with problem size
The error decreases with finer grids

For Question 3.3, observe how:

The convergence rate depends on the condition number
The residual decreases approximately linearly on a log scale
The observed convergence matches the theoretical prediction

These observations validate the theoretical properties of the CG method as discussed in the detailed explanation.
Important Notes

For larger problem sizes (especially N = 10⁵ in Q3.3), you may need substantial memory and computation time.
The condition numbers used in the analysis are approximations. In a real implementation, you would compute them using specialized libraries.
The plotting scripts require gnuplot to be installed.
